For example, animals and crops run on their time frame. Crops need to be watered and maintained, animals need to be fed and cleaned, It helps to care for something outside of your mind, but it's also rewarding to see you make something or someone happy and growing. It is an expressionless way to find your success in small things. </p>-->

        <p>Remote full-time web developer. Maintaining and making websites for her company is stressful, but she works from home. She uses a MacBook Pro 14-inch for work, along with a Samsun Galaxy A32 5G that she uses to control her lights, locks, and her security system in her home, along with her smart tvs. She loves her data connection, which is firefox. She depends on it a lot throughout the day. She is not much into Facebook but loves TikTok. She also plays a game on her phone when waiting on something. She spends so much time on screen that she would rather be outside with her animals and daughter than spend the free time she has inside.</p>
        <p>She is short on time, stressed, has panic attacks. She will not spend more than 3 minutes looking at sites, she loves cooking healthy meals, animals, growing plants for food.</p>
        <p>Shari is concerned about her mental health: are there other ways she has not thought of for my mental health? Can she do this without medication?.</p>
    <p>As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this cite will help or guide me in the right direction, and if other people have the same questions as I do.</p>
