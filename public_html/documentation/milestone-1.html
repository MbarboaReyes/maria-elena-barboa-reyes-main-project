    <p>Daniella Barboa</p>
        <p>34</p>
        <p>Remote full time web developer. Works with a very large Web software and is stressed
            because she maintains and makes websites for her company.
            She uses both Apple and Dell laptop. With a android phone that controls her lights,
            locks along with her security system in her home. She loves her data connection.
            Daniella loves to learn off of social media, and is big into fashion.
            She's into very expensive cars and has a heavy-duty truck.
            She knows she's very spoiled, and money is her focus on work. But it does not compare what
            she does for her animals who get prime feed, in which she does not just look at the price but
            the quality. Her chickens, horse and cat have a better life then some people.
            Daniella also loves to help her community, family and friends.</p>
        </ul>
   </p>
    <p>Daniella will like my cite because its easy to access through her web browser that she uses. We also offer honest
        reviews, we adore our animals and want them to be happy just like she does. She also might like the good quality
        of gear for horseback riding, taking good care of your chickens and other animals, that at the same time looks cute. You can have your
        own little slice of Yellowstone. We are simply here just for the love of our animals. If we didn't spoil our Chickens who will? </p>
